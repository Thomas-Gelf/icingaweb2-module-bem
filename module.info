Description: BMC (ProactiveNet) Event Manager© integration
  This Icinga Web 2 module has been written to allow for an easy integration of
  your Icinga environment with **BMC (ProactiveNet) Event Manager©** installations.

  This component is responsible for sending events to the BMC Event Console through
  the **ImpactPoster** (`msend`). This module provides a standalone notification
  command or can alternatively run as a daemon in the background.
